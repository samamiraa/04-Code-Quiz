## Description

I was very overwhelmed with Javascript, I thought Web API's broke my brain. This actually motivated me to understand how to make everything work. I built this assignment to help solidify my understanding. I am a hands on learner, so applying my knowledge into this project helped. I learned the console log is your bestfriend to help debug your code!

First you will start at the start screen<br>

After you answer all 10 questions or if the timer reaches 0, you will be directed to save your score and input your initials<br>
<br>
